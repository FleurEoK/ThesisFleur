#Thesis Code
The SemAIM files can be run locally, to train the main_pretrain file should be run.

For all files: 'data path' and 'permutation folder' should be adjusted to proper location.

Inference can be done through the main_inference file
For testing purposes the 'hutsel' folder was constructed containing both a  folder with permuted images as well as 'normal' images of cats. These are reconstructed after training SemAIM which is saved in the 'reconstruction_analysis' folder. 

The diagnosis script is purely for testing/ insight purposes, as is the loss_visualization script.
